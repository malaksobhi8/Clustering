# Clustering
This clustering analysis project offers insights into home energy consumption patterns and provides a framework for optimizing home electronics sales strategies. By understanding the clustering tendencies and assessing clustering quality, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to target specific groups of homeownersÂ effectively.

Key Steps:

Dataset Selection: A dataset containing at least two relevant features for clustering was chosen. Features include power consumption, house area, and the number of occupants.
Clustering Tendency Test: The Hopkins statistic was used to assess the dataset's tendency to cluster. If the tendency was low, alternative datasets were considered.
Cluster Number Assessment: The empirical or elbow method was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) for the K-Medoid algorithm.
Clustering Algorithms: Both K-Medoid and DBSCAN clustering algorithms were applied using a programming language (e.g., Python) to cluster the dataset.
Visualization: The results of the clustering analysis were visualized to illustrate the clusters and their respective points.
Clustering Quality Evaluation: The quality of clustering was evaluated extrinsically using recall (if ground truth was available) and intrinsically using relevant metrics such as the silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz score, and Davies-Bouldin score.
Discussion: A brief discussion was provided on the quality results of each algorithm, highlighting which algorithm suited the dataset better and the reasons behind the choice.
